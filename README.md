# Graph Visualization App

This Graph Visualization App is a Java-based application designed to facilitate the creation, manipulation, and visualization of graphs using various generation techniques and visualization algorithms.
Features

    Graph Generation Tool:
        Random Graph: Generate graphs by specifying the number of nodes and the probability of edges.
        Complete Graph: Create complete graphs by specifying the number of nodes.
        Regular Graph: Generate regular graphs by specifying the number of nodes and the degree.
        Directed/Undirected Graphs: Allow the user to choose between directed or undirected graphs during generation.

    Graph Customization:
        Create and modify nodes/edges individually to form customized graphs according to user preferences.

    Visualization Algorithms:
        Tutte's Barycenter Method: Visualization algorithm based on graph barycenters.
        Eade's Spring Embedder: Uses spring-like forces between nodes for graph visualization.
        Fruchterman-Reingold Spring Algorithm: A force-directed algorithm for graph layout.

    Graph Viewing Themes:
        Classic Light Mode: Default theme for graph visualization.
        Dark Mode: Dark-themed visualization for easier viewing in low-light environments.
        Small Nodes Mode: A mode that displays nodes in a smaller size for a compact view.

    Upcoming Implementations:
        Magnetic Fields Algorithm: Planned implementation to visualize graphs using magnetic fields.
        Sugiyama's Layered Methodology: Future addition to allow layered graph visualization.

Usage

    Graph Generation:
        Access the Graph Generation Tool from the user interface.
        Choose the type of graph (random, complete, regular) and specify the necessary parameters.
        Select whether the graph should be directed or undirected.

    Custom Graph Creation:
        Alternatively, create a custom graph by adding nodes and edges manually.

    Visualization:
        Use the implemented visualization algorithms to visualize the generated or custom graphs.
        Choose from Tutte's Barycenter, Eade's Spring Embedder, or Fruchterman-Reingold Spring methods.
        Switch between different graph viewing themes: Classic Light Mode, Dark Mode, or Small Nodes Mode.
