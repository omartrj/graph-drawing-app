# Graph Visualization App

This Graph Visualization App is a simple Java-based application designed to facilitate the creation, manipulation, and visualization of graphs using various generation techniques and visualization algorithms.

## Features

1. **Graph Generation Tool**:
   - Random Graph: Generate graphs by specifying the number of nodes and the probability of edges.
   - Complete Graph: Create complete graphs by specifying the number of nodes.
   - Regular Graph: Generate regular graphs by specifying the number of nodes and the degree.
   - Directed/Undirected Graphs: Allow the user to choose between directed or undirected graphs during generation.

2. **Graph Customization**:
   - Create and modify nodes/edges individually to form customized graphs according to user preferences.

3. **Visualization Algorithms**:
   - Tutte's Barycenter Method: Visualization algorithm based on graph barycenters.
   - Eade's Spring Embedder: Uses spring-like forces between nodes for graph visualization.
   - Fruchterman-Reingold Spring Algorithm: A force-directed algorithm for graph layout.

4. **Graph Viewing Themes**:
   - Light Mode: Default theme for graph visualization.
   - Dark Mode: Dark-themed visualization for easier viewing in low-light environments.
   - Small Nodes Mode: A mode that displays nodes in a smaller size for a compact view.

5. **Explore Graphs**:
   - Explore graphs by zooming in/out and panning across the graph.

## Usage

1. **Graph Generation**:
   - Access the Graph Generation Tool from the user interface.
   - Choose the type of graph (random, complete, regular) and specify the necessary parameters.
   - Select whether the graph should be directed or undirected.

2. Custom Graph Creation:
   - Alternatively, create a custom graph by adding nodes and edges manually.

3. Visualization:
   - Use the implemented visualization algorithms to visualize the generated or custom graphs.
   - Choose from Tutte's Barycenter, Eade's Spring Embedder, or Fruchterman-Reingold Spring methods.
   - Switch between different graph viewing themes: Classic Light Mode, Dark Mode, or Small Nodes Mode.
